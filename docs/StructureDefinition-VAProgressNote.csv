","Optional Extensions Element","Some Document Definitions, for example, CWAD's, are developed nationally and sent out as standardized entries across the nation.  TIU and other packages depend on their standard definition, and they must not be edited by sites but only by the persons who are nationally responsible for them.   Such entries are marked NATIONAL STANDARD (field has value 1 for YES), which generally prevents sites from editing the entry.   In two cases, sites are permitted to edit National Standard entries.  The first case concerns Titles.  Sites can edit Status and Abbreviation for National Titles.  Status INACTIVE for a National Title prevents manual and upload entry of documents for the Title, while continuing to permit automatic entry for the Title via the TIU application interface for new notes. (Example: Adverse Reaction/Allergy notes are automatically entered by the Allergy package.) Editing Abbreviation gives sites a means of grouping national titles with other National and non-National Titles as they please.   The second case where edit of National entries is permitted concerns the Item Multiple:   If a National Standard entry has Type Class or Document Class, sites can add/delete Nonnational items as they please, and can edit ALL items AS ITEMS (e.g. Item Sequence, etc.).  Sites CANNOT add/delete National items.   If a National Standard entry has Type Title or Component, sites cannot add or delete items, but can still edit items AS ITEMS.   Sites cannot add National Standard entries as Items to parents.  There is one exception: Sites can add National Shared Components to (nonnational) Titles if they wish.  Sites can delete National Standard Items from nonnational parents. (Unless there has been a mistake, such items will be limited to Shared Components only.)   Field is NOT heritable.  If field has no value for an entry, value is 0 by default.  This means that entries created by sites are NOT National Standard.   Technical Note:   National entries (except for Shared Components) must have National ancestors:  if a National entry has a nonNational ancestor, the Document Definition Utility TIUF does not permit it to be activated. (Shared Components need not have National ancestors, and do not have a Status.)

","Plain text representation of the concept","The name of a Document Definition entry (.01 field) must be between 3 and 60 characters long and may not begin with a punctuation character. Although names can be entered in any case, they are transformed to upper case before being stored.   It functions as the Technical Name of the entry.  Some sites have put KWIC cross references on it to get, say, all Titles from a given Service.   Name can be used when entering documents as the name of the Title being entered.  Print Name and Abbreviation will also be accepted.   Since it is the Technical, .01 Name, the Document Definition Utility (TIUF) uses this name throughout.   The .01 name differs from the Print Name, which appears in lists of documents and functions as the Title of the document.   It also differs from Item Menu Text (1-20 characters), which is used when selecting documents from 3-COLUMN MENUS.   The ORDER of names in TIUF options Edit Document Definitions and Create Document Definitions is by Item Sequence under the parent.  Order is alphabetic by Menu Text if an Item has no Item Sequence.   When a new entry is added to file 8925.1, the Document Definition Utility (TIUF) enters the Name as the default Print Name.  The Print Name can be edited if a different Print Name is desired.   File 8925.1 permits more than 1 entry with the same name as long as they don't have the same Type.  In that sense, NAMES are reusable.  However, ENTRIES are NOT reusable (except specially marked Components): an entry is NOT allowed to be an item under more than one parent unless it is a Shared Component.  (See Type Component.)   Name is a BASIC Field.                                  OBJECT Name  Object Names, like any other names are 3-60 characters, not starting with punctuation.  Sites may want to namespace object names, use the object Print Name as a more familiar name, and use object Abbreviation as a short name to embed in boilerplate text.  Unlike other Types, Object Abbreviation and Print Name as well as Name must be uppercase.   Object Name, Abbreviation, or Print Name can be embedded in boilerplate text.  Since TIU must be able to determine from this which object is intended, object Names, Abbreviations, and Print Names must be unique.  In fact, an object Name must differ not only from every other object name, but also from every other object Abbreviation and from every other object Print Name.  Same for Abbreviations and Print Names.  For example, if some object has abbreviation 'CND', then 'CND' cannot be used for any other object Name, Abbreviation, or Print Name.","Very often the text is the same as a displayName of one of the codings.","The codes from the terminologies do not always capture the correct meaning with all the nuances of the human using them, or sometimes there is no appropriate code at all.
