Contemporary knowledge suggests that some reactions previously thought to be immune-mediated are, in fact, non-immune, but in some cases can still pose a life threatening risk. It is acknowledged that many clinicians may not be in a position to distinguish the mechanism of a particular reaction. Often the term ""allergy"" is used rather generically and may overlap with the use of ""intolerance"" - in practice the boundaries between these two concepts may not be well-defined or understood. This data element is included nevertheless, because many legacy systems have captured this attribute. Immunologic testing may provide supporting evidence for the basis of the reaction and the causative substance, but no tests are 100% sensitive or specific for sensitivity to a particular substance. If, as is commonly the case, it is unclear whether the reaction is due to an allergy or an intolerance, then the type element should be omitted from the resource.","","","","","","","","",,"required","Identification of the underlying physiological mechanism for a Reaction Risk.","http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/allergy-intolerance-type","",,,,"AllergyIntolerance.type",0,1,"","","PATIENT ALLERGIES @MECHANISM 120.8-17","code","class","IAM-9"
