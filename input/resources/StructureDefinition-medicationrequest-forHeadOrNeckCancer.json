	"description": "During CPRS order entry, if a veteran has been identified as having been treated for Head and/or Neck Cancer due to nose or throat radium treatments while in the military, the clinician will be asked to identify whether or not the outpatient medication order prescribed is being used to treat this condition. This field will store the response that was entered for this question. This value will be used as the default value for the same prompt presented to the pharmacist when finishing the medication order that was entered through CPRS.",
