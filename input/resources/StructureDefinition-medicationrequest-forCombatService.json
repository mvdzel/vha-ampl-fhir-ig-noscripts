  "description": "During Outpatient Pharmacy order entry, a pharmacist may be asked if the  medication being prescribed is for a condition related to Combat Services  while in the military. This field will store the pharmacist's response to this question. The value in this field will be used to evaluate whether or not a copay should be applied to the prescription. This value will also be used as a default should this question be raised again during the life of the prescription."
