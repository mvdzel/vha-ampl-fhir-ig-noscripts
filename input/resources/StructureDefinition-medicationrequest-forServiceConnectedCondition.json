This field will store the pharmacist's response to this question. The value in this field will be used to evaluate whether or not a copay should be applied to the prescription. This value will also be used as a default should this question be raised again during the life of the prescription when a prescription fill is being released, or as the default for the question upon renewal of the prescription through CPRS or Outpatient Pharmacy.",
