	"description": "During CPRS order entry, if a veteran has been identified as having been treated for a condition related to PROJ 112/SHAD, the clinician will be  asked to identify whether or not the outpatient medication order being  prescribed is being used to treat a condition related to PROJ 112/SHAD.  This field will store the response that was entered for this question.   This value will be used as the default value for the same prompt presented to the pharmacist when finishing the medication order that was entered through CPRS.",
